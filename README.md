# DESCRIPTION

- Program 1: This program considers requests in the form of the number of customers willing to travel from point A to point B. It aims to maximize revenue by planning routes where revenue is calculated as the product of the number of customers and the flying distance. The program uses heuristic directives and a multi-level optimization objective (currently in development). Different constraints are handled using clingo-dl.

- Program 2: This program considers requests with the number of customers willing to travel from point A to point B at step X. It focuses on maximizing the total number of customers served over the planning horizon.

Each program folder includes a README.md with instructions for running the code.
